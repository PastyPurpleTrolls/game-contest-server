# Referee Examples

This directory contains example referee files and plugins. Please refer to them as you develop new referees for new game types.

[Read the documentation](https://github.com/PastyPurpleTrolls/game-contest-server/blob/master/documentation/creator/referee.md).

## Existing Referees

- Checkers has a completely working referee and player. The replay plugin is fully functional.
- The top level of examples contains a test referee and player along with a test replay plugin. These are the bare essentials required for a referee and plugin.
- The Risk referee and player are complete and ready to use. A replay plugin needs to be developed in order to replay rounds.
