The Game Contest Website is an interactive, web based manager for automated turn-based game contests.

#Terminology

* Player- a student’s submitted file to play in a contest.
* Rounds- one specific instance of a game. For example, a single game of checkers, or a single game of risk. Consists of two or more players.
* Matches- 1 or more rounds, each round with the same players.
* Tournaments- a competition between two or more players. The competition consists of a series of matches. For example, a single elimination tournament.
* Contests- 1 or more tournaments. It may not be the case that every tournament has the same players. For example, a contest consisting of two tournaments. The first tournament consists of each player playing a single match. If a given player cannot successfully complete a match (e.g. the player enters an infinite loop and thus fails to complete a turn), then that player does not enter the second tournament.
* Referee- the instructor’s program that defines the rules of matches, and enforces those rules.
