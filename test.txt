    Merge branch 'j-term'
    
    Had to add a couple additional fixes to get the 5.1 merge to continue to pass
    most of the tests from the previous commit. The only new test that is failing
    is spec/features/referees_spec.rb:268, which I am not sure was working at the
    end of last year since it was merged with Eric's code at the last minute and
    he may not have had time to debug it.  Leaving it for this semester to try
    and figure out what the problem is and how to fix it permanently.

    Update to Rails 5.1
    
    This mostly works *EXCEPT* for the validations that use the
    validates_timeliness gem.  That gem has not been updated for Rails 5.0 and so
    it breaks hard.  I'll have to fix that going forward, but all the other tests
    pass and so they should be able to be used in development while this last
    fix gets worked on.

    Move Timecop.freeze out of test configuration
    
    Libby's work to add Javascript to some tests conflicted with Timecop
    explicitly.  She just commented it out to let her tests run, but this
    is the submission that makes sure that only the tests that need
    Timecop actually use it.  There are now only two instances of Timecop:
    one each in spec/modes/contest_spec.rb and spec/models/match_spec.rb.
    
    The other big set of changes was to be able to handle dynamic dates and
    times without the help of Timecop anymore.  By far, the biggest set of
    changes were handling minutes in times since we only display select boxes
    with multiples of 5 for the minutes.  The tests now embed that assumption
    deeply (see spec/support/dates.rb and spec/support.forms.rb).
    
    All tests properly pass with the exception of the notorious 4 that have been
    failing all j-term long.

    Bug fix submission.  When challenging a player to a multi-round match, x matches of x rounds were created.  The solution was found within the Matches_Controller file.  This involved deleting a line of code which I assume to be legacy code.  Everything seems to still be just fine, but their might be something that I've missed.

    Make new directory for Guess W example
    
    The examples directory was getting big enough and has enough examples
    that the simplistic guess W example was confusing with the other
    directories with specific examples.  This commit gives guess W its own
    directory to clearly delineate what belongs to that example and how it
    is/isn't related to any other examples.

    Handle timeout gracefully
    
    This code is supposed to keep track of the timeout given to the
    referee by the manager so that it can terminate the game based on who
    we were last waiting for a message.  This is not perfect if both
    players are making progress, but works correctly if one has an
    infinite loop.  If we want to put tighter constraints on each player,
    we will probably have to insert multiple alarm() calls (or something
    even more fine grained) so that we can attribute the timeout to the
    slow player and not to the last player that got caught when the alarm
    is triggered.

    Get replay working on server
    
    This commit includes all the changes necessary to visualize the
    battleships player on the server.  Mostly this consists of debugging
    the script.js file as expected.  There were several other changes,
    though:
        * rename makefile -> Makefile because the server expects that
          uppercase character.
        * adding <stdexcept> because the compiler on the server is older
          and needs that extra include file to put run time exceptions in
          the std namespace
        * adding makefile rules to play games properly
        * not expecting a number of games to be given to the player, but
          to continue until the server stops sending new games.
        * output Loss instead of Lose

    This is the first cut at the prototype code.  It needs to be tested
    and run on the browser, but that requires using the server, etc.  This
    is a commit to get it in git so it can be pulled and worked on from
    the server.  It is very possible that there are syntax errors in
    addition to any logic errors that inevitably exist throughout the
    code.

    Log ship placements
    
    In order for the replay functionality to be able to handle a kill, we
    need to pass additional information about the kill.  Using the
    existing architecture, either
    
        1. we need to have multiple moves which indicate all the locations
           for the ship that was killed, or
        2. we need to add moves that show the placement of ships.
    
    Option #1 is less preferred because the interface assumes each move is
    meaningful and predictable.  We don't know how many ship elements will
    be generated by a single kill shot.
    
    Option #2 is more preferred because it allows us to make the UI better
    because we can do cool things like turn on and off a display of where
    the ships are while they are being shot at.  Without option #2, we
    only know where ships are when they've been hit.  Since the players
    don't have access to the logs during run time, this is a better
    choice.

    Clean up AIContest::processShot()
    
    The code had a lot of duplicate looking code.  By rearranging the code
    to call player.update() most of the time and then simply passing
    through the character result of message sent to the player, this
    greatly simplifies the code to make it easier to handle and read.

    player names, we don't store a copy of the name twice.  Any time we

    members of AIContest are simply removed in this update.

    Handle broken sockets & code cleanup
    
    In an effort to chase down a bug that was exhibited when a player
    socket was closed too early, I did some code cleanup mostly with
    variables that were not being used any longer by the gcs referee.
    Additionally, extra cerr output was removed since it will not be
    recorded by the server.
    
    Once the bug was narrowed down, it was easy to see that the problem
    was that communication with a player that was finished was causing a
    SIGPIPE instead of just returning an error.  Installing a signal
    handler that ignored the error returned the program to expected state
    and things worked correctly.
    
    This commit includes both the fix and code cleanup because it is
    slightly intertwined.

    Separate player define from makefile
    
    In order to let the student define their player name and classes, we
    will include a file named cpp-player.mk in their submission.  That
    file can define the player and any other compilation instructions
    necessary to complete their player.  We will include the makefile as
    the instructor, which includes the cpp-player.mk file as part of the
    build process so that we can incorporate all the student's needs while
    still making the proxy based on our code--not theirs.

    Make player a compile-time option for proxy
    
    By making the Player define in the makefile, we can now choose which
    player to compile into the player proxy.  The code expects the player
    class name to be the same as the .h and .cpp file names because it
    does a #include based on the define using PLAYER_H and then declares
    a variable based on the define using PLAYER.

    Modify the AIContest so that it will work better with the game contest

    direct calls to the player to become output sent to the manager via
    the network and networked communication between the referee and
    players via proxies.
    
    Almost everything is complete except figuring out how to include the
    proper player code in the proxy.

    Remove old code
    
    All code that is no longer used is removed from the current version of
    the repo.  If needed, it can be fetched with an appropriate git
    checkout since it has been put in the repo originally.

    be more easily adaptable for the game contest server.

    Update C++ player and referee for new log protocol
    
    This commit reintroduces all the code necessary to support C++
    referees and players.  This is especially important for the COS 121
    course.  In total, we need
    
        * Makefile to support creating and running the programs.  The
          Makefile is expected to include a cpp-player.mk file so that it
          accommodates the student code specific content.
        * cpp-player.mk simply points to the test player, but could be
          used to incorporate more instructions and files for the student
          players.
        * test_referee.cpp is a prototype for interacting with the manager
        * test_player.cpp is a prototype for interacting with the Guess W!
          referees.
        * socketstream.h is code that creates a socketstream class that
          allows C++ I/O streams to communicate over TCP sockets and a
          server class that waits for connections on a TCP socket.  When
          the server receives a connection, it returns a pointer to a
          newly created socketstream.
        * player_connection.h is a class that keeps track of state for
          each player, including the socketstream to use for
          communication.  This is similar to what most referees will need
          to be able to talk with all the players.
        * player_connection.cpp is the implementation file for
          player_connection.h
    
    This also includes a small change to the Python player so that it can
    also communicate with the C++ referee.

    I made a migration to change Referee's match_limit to round_limit, and this caused many tests to fail. Fortunately, simply replacing match_limit with round_limit in a number of files was essentially the solution. There are only a few tests (11) that aren't passing, but I don't believe that they are related to this change.
    
    Other changes were relatively minor. They included adding some tests, making sure they failed, then making sure they passed.

    Remove dummy_player from FactoryGirl
    
    The dummy_player was garbage!  I don't know how it even worked before.
    These changes now make sure that the factories properly make matches
    for existing players.  The big changes were in how winning and losing
    matches were performed.  The code works, but could probably be
    refactored.  I'm just not sure how to do this the best way.

    Produce 2-player round robin matches correctly
    
    The old code for the round robin would only work if there were only
    two players in the tournament because it just randomized them and
    assumed that create_match would grab the first two players.  This code
    explicitly goes through a double-nested loop to produce all possible
    pairs of players and does the right thing.

    Clean up game loop
    
    The previous game loop was an unnecessarily complicated double loop,
    when a single loop would do.  This fixes that issue and also puts the
    declaration of the buffer inside the loop since the value is not
    reused from loop-to-loop or outside the loop after it is completed.

    properly.

    Handle uploads without proper names
    
    Since upload=() ties to values during the object build, we can't yet check
    whether name is created properly or not.  The two options are:
    
    	1.  Check for name being set before messing with the uploads, or
    	2.  Calling upload=() explicitly when we know that everything
    	    about the object is valid.
    
    This commit is #1, but #2 is probably more robust.  Unfortunately, it results
    in a lot of code churn and seems wrong somehow.  This will probably need to
    be revisited during a refactor stage of the code.

    Fix validation to call parameterless method
    
    delete_code had previously been written without a parameter, but when
    refactoring of the code was done it was added without notice.  Running the
    test suite caught this bug-a-boo and so this fix goes in to keep the code
    clean and also work with the validation stuff.

    It was really debugging output that should have been removed before being
    added to the repository in the first place.

    Pass correct number of parameters to MatchWrapper
    
    The MatchWrapper class had been modified to take an additional number of
    rounds parameter and the test had not be updated to reflect the change.
    The simple change here is to hard code a 1 for this parameter since the
    previous tests had always assumed that situation previously.

    the referees hadn't been modified to accept it.  Fixed enough to pass tests,
    but no other referees have been modified.

    The test forgot to select the rounds per match in the test and so the
    validation in the tournament model was firing preventing a tournament
    from being created.  Slightly modified the view to make it easier to
    write the test, but should have the same visual output.

    Update commit to work on CSE VM
    
    We had to update the Gemfile to use a more recent version of eventmachine
    because we are using Ruby 2.2 on the CSE VM and it would not work with the
    version I had uploaded on my machine.  There was also a change to the
    tournament runner script that was somehow not modified in my local commit.
    
    On quick review, everything seems to be working here with the 4.2.0 version
    of Rails and so it is ready to merge with the master version to use the
    latest and greatest.

    Update application for Rails 4.2
    
    These changes allow the code to run using Rails 4.2.0.  The biggest
    set of changes is to also upgrade to RSpec 3.1.  This may not have
    been necessary, but while chasing down a bug it spec/support/login.rb,
    I decided to make the upgrade in case there was an incompatibility
    with RSpec 2.14 and Rails 4.2 since the release notes for RSpec 3.1
    indicated full support for Rails 4.2.  The bug was more pernicious
    than that and may still work on the older version of RSpec, but there
    is no point in downgrading when all the specs work with the newer
    version.
    
    The major bug fixes included in this commit are:
    
        1.  The old version of validates_timeliness depended on an older
    	implementation of how Rails was assigning values to date and
    	time objects.  The change to that is committed in a separate
    	repository, but this needs to point to that latest version.
        2.  The "redirects to root" shared example referred to earlier was
    	being called in "feature" mode, but depending on "request"
    	mode and so the first before action was failing with a
    	difficult error to track down.  The solution was to wrap all
    	the code in a context that forced everything to be in
    	"request" mode and suddenly everything worked properly.
    
    Everything else is explanatory by the diffs.

    Improve clockwork performance
    
    We have two problems that were eating up a ton of space on the server:
    
        1.  The daemons weren't cleaning up zombie processes properly,
    	filling up the process table extensively.
        2.  The programs that tested whether work should be done were
    	taking 100% CPU to load the Rails environment.
    
    The first problem was fixed simply by adding wait() after
    Process.spawn statements to make things work properly.  The second was
    fixed by using Spring to preload the Rails environment and then
    running them under rails runner instead of trying to check and only
    load the minimum set of libraries necessary to do the checks.  Since
    Rails is preloaded with Spring, these become very small operations to
    perform and the CPU utilization goes way down.

    Move from spork to spring.
    
    This commit allows us to use spring that is built in to Rails 4.1
    instead of spork as a separate gem.  This involved making some changes
    to the Gemfile so that spring could find them all and also installing
    the gems into the vendor/cache directory, hence the modification to
    the .gitignore file.

    Properly list array of ids in strong parameters
    
    For both the matches and tournament creation, we pass a hash of player
    ids that should be added to the created item.  The old code simply did
    a query from the DB to get a list of all possible valid ids and
    returned an array of integers for the strong parameter filter to use.
    This patch modifies the array to be strings since the hash that comes
    from the browser stringifies all the values and so the filter was not
    passing the ids through properly.  Now this is corrected.

    Allow MatchWrapper to use players with spaces in names
    
    There was a bug in the MatchWrapper that did not quote the player
    name on the command line, so any player name with spaces was
    improperly sent to the player on startup.  This is a simple fix that
    quotes the player name so it appears as a single string to the player
    upon startup.

    Change hard-coded path for new machine.
    
    The original hard-coded path was for the J-term VM.  This commit now
    points to my local directory.  A more permanent change that doesn't
    have a hard-coded path is needed, but I need to use the repository now
    before looking into how it can be fixed.

    Done as far as I know with features/tournament. Getting ready to merge.
    
    Also, solved some tests that Geisler had laying around unsolved.
    (Show all players in contest).
    
    And fixed one that was failing for the wrong reason. Users editing
    file_location was failing because he was giving an illegal file
    location, not because we were saying they couldn't. So that's fixed
    now, but I have concerns similar tests may exist.
    
    It's also possible his edit tests aren't doing anything since I found
    some that just replaced the old values with the same value, then
    checked that it equaled the new value. But new == old. So we need to
    look through those as well.

    Fix nasty bug in match validation test
    
    I wasn't generating matches correctly and so the tests were blowing up
    pretty badly for everyone.  This should hopefully fix the issue.

    Refactor FactoryGirl definitions
    
    This code just works and looks a whole lot nicer than the previous
    commit.  The only thing I'm unhappy with is the dummy_player value.
    It is fragile and could break, but there isn't a way to define a

    Fix broken tests with new factories
    
    Now that the match factories automatically create the right number of
    player_matches, some tests were breaking because they assumed none
    were being created.  This fixes them to match the reality and now
    assume the right number of player_matches have already been created.

    Match factories not generating valid models
    
    The old factory was not generating valid match models.  The changes
    in this commit are required to make them valid, which is odd because
    we explicitly turn off validation during creation (see to_create
    method override).  The issue here is that while creating the
    player_matches for the match, rails needs to know what match_id to
    place in the player_match.  To do this, it tries to save the match to
    get an id, but the match is not valid yet.  The match needs to have
    all the player_matches associated with it before this can be done.  By
    turning off validation while we create the player_matches, we can fix
    this chicken-and-egg problem.

    Pass initial match tests.
    
    These are the changes necessary to pass the match tests.  There were
    several significant items to note:
    
        1.  We use shallow routing for matches because we want to show
    	matches for a particular contest--not all matches in the
    	system.
        2.  We needed to add a virtual method to the referee model named
    	referee that pointed to itself so that a contest can just ask
    	its manager for the referee and not worry about whether to
    	manager is a contest or referee.  It just works nicely this
    	way.
        3.  We had to have two ways to display the player_matches
    	associative entity depending on which direction it was being
    	accessed from.  The match_links and player_links partials take
    	care of giving the proper directionality.

    find these dates as illegal via the wrong mechanism and still have an
    error in them.  Fixed with this commit.

    The illegal date test was putting the deadline into the future, but
    not the start date, so some validations might mark them as being
    illegal, but for the wrong reason.  Now we make the start date illegal
    since it will be ahead of the deadline and will only catch problems if
    the model properly checks the user checkboxes' input correctly.

    More sophisticated validations of referee and contest
    
    These tests make sure we are not putting bad values into the referee
    or contest.  They are more complicated than the previous tests because
    they consider the application logic and not just existence of data.
    For example, the contest deadline must be in the future and the start
    of the contest cannot start before the deadline.  There are several
    other similar validations like this that just make sense when thinking
    about the values that can be stored for these entities.

    More referee and contest validations
    
    These check that we are getting legal values for the contest and
    referee models in place, so most of the tests are in the model specs.
    The exceptions are when the input from the browser could look legal,
    but not be (e.g., picking February 31st).  The model needs to discover
    and disallow such options.
    
    We include a gem (validates_timeliness) to help with this, as Rails
    decides to make that a legal date by forwarding the appropriate number
    of days and we need to munge with Rails internals to get ahold of the
    values submitted before they get turned into a date that is valid, but
    not what the user chose in the browser.
    
    The implementation included also passes the corresponding tests being
    committed.

    Rename long colorscheme route
    
    This route was named as a result of being matched with a get in the
    config/routes.rb file.  This commit just shortens the name to make it
    easier to read the rest of the rake routes task.

    Fix up Guardfile
    
    Guard wasn't finding the right rspec tests because I was using plural
    names for my test files instead of singular names.  This commit makes
    the proper modifications to use the plural name instead.

    Handle timing issue in test
    
    The tests were checking for 'less than a minute', but could sometimes
    produce '1 minute' depending on when the data was entered in the
    database compared with when it was checked in the file.  The test will
    probably be replaced in the future, but this accepts both outputs for
    now.

    Test for simple contest creation
    
    These tests check that a contest can be created.  More tests need to
    be added for additional functionality in the creation (e.g., ensuring
    the user has the create_contest bit set), but this does a good
    starting job.

    previously.  This existed in the ERD, but was simply missing in the
    tests.

    These tests ensure that the application meets the particular structure
    laid out in the course-wide ERD.  By passing these tests, the models

    validations.  There are no functional tests correctly written, yet.
    There are several ones started that are set to pending until they are
    completed correctly.

    These tests additionally check for one-to-many associations as well as
    contain the initial tests for creating a contest manager.  The contest
    manager tests will continue to need development.
    
    As a part of this commit, we are creating code/ directories for
    storing the contest managers, but .gitignore updates so those files
    don't get included in the repo.  This should ensure that everyone has
    the directories created for them, but doesn't try to pass around all
    these managers accidentally.

    This fixes the shared error message so that it can be used by other
    models than User by fixing the rather poor assumption that all errors
    emanate from the @user object.  Now, the error message partial expects
    to be passed a variable named object that contains the error messages
    to be displayed.

    they can edit their profile and that the user is automatically logged
    in when their account is created.

    Additional login functionality.
    
    This commit includes functionality to automatically sign in users with
    they sign up for the site and then testing to make sure that they are
    signed in before they edit their profile page.  The biggest missing
    security feature now is the administrator that should be the user
    that can delete other accounts.  To appear in a commit soon-ish...

    Initial ability to log in and out
    
    This is a small set of files that will allow us to log in and out as a
    user.  It is not complete from testing or functionality, but gets a
    lot of the core done without complicating the issues.  More needs to
    be added to ensure testing is done properly and that persistent
    sessions can be supported safely.

    Simple tests for the Bootstrap navigation bar
    
    This test simply checks that we've tried to put in a navigation bar
    and the corresponding links.  It needs some fixing that will make it
    more specific when a particular bug can be traced, but for now is
    "good enough."

    More theming for bootstrap.
    
    We now have a more consistent colorscheme and a controller that allows
    us to run simple visual tests on the screen that can't be automated
    since we want to see what the colors look like--not how the web site
    performs.
    
    There are probably still colors left default to the bootstrap theme
    that should be modified to incorporate the new colorscheme and so more
    commits will need to be done.

    Forgot to use let! for creating the user, so we never lazily created
    the user before loading the users_pages and so no delete links were

    and whether a user can be edited after already in the system.  There
    are loads of security flaws that could exist in an implementation that
    are not addressed with these tests.  Those will come later after we
    can be certain that users can log in to the system.

    Fix up previous test.
    
    After running test with viable candidates, I discovered two errors in
    the test that needed to be fixed.  The first was that I was using let
    inside a before(:all), which isn't allowed.  The second was that I
    wasn't destroying the data created in the before(:all) because they
    are created outside a transaction.  Both flaws fixed in this commit.

    Create tests for validating user.
    
    These tests validate the user at the model and web submission levels.
    They ensure that we will not accept an invalid user and require the
    user to submit reasonable values for creating a new user.
    
    The interface is not being tested, yet.  We do not ensure that when an
    error occurs for these validations being triggered that we pass them
    on to the user so that they can know what to do to correct the issue.
    That will come later.

    Don't accept submissions for invalid users.
    
    We add a test in the form submission that ensures the user model
    validation is being called correctly.  We simply try submitting an
    empty user for now.  This could get more robust, but the user model is
    already checking those cases, so full duplication here seems silly.
    We just want to make sure the web form doesn't bypass the validation
    in some weird manner.

    Test for duplicate usernames
    
    We want to ensure that duplicate usernames are disallowed, but to pass
    through any duplicate email addresses in case we want to have the same
    address point to multiple accounts.  This requirement could always get
    more strict and include only one account/email address, but it is so
    easy to create a new email address, why bother?

    too loose, or too strict with our pattern.
    
    NOTE: examples come directly from Michael Hartl's Rails tutorial.

    one view template that both actions point to.  Not a big deal for a
