        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Taylor University's game contest server is designed to be a website that allows professors to host contests for various games, such as checkers, risk, and battleships. Students will then be able to develop and submit automated players for these games to challenge each other and determine who can program the best player!</p>
        <p>Dr. Geisler's Multi-tier Web Application Development class began writting this Game Contest Server using Ruby on Rails in the fall of 2013. </p>
